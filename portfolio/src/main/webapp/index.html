        <p> 
            Hello, I am Sofia Montana De Bedout, I am twenty year old 
            university student from Miami, Florida. I really like Computer Science and

            from Bogota, Colombia and I am fully bilingual in Spanish and English. I love 
            playing video games, watching Netflix and playing sports. Also, I am quite the Math

                        different cultures. One of my favorite things about Miami
                        is the heavy Cuban influence. I love being from here.

                    <p>
                        Bad Bunny is my all time favorite music artist.
                        Bad Bunny is huge in the Latino community and I love
                        his music and videos. Also, I went to his last concert 
                        in Miami. It was insane, he was so good live 10/10
                        recommend.

                        I love soccer and have loved it all my life.
                        Growing up my family and I would watch soccer matches
                        on the tv a lot. We always host watch parties during the Fifa World Cup
                        to watch Colombia games. It is a lot of fun. Let's go 
                        Colombia!
